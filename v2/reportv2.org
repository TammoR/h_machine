* Sampling overview
- Here: N = 600 mnist images, only the digits (9, 2, 7); M = 16 codes.
- Convergence is basically reached after ~10 iterations
- Codes (U) and input units (S) are random binomial (.5) initialised.
- Ignoring pixels that are >95% the same across all N brings (obviously) a nice speed up.
- Lambda is sampled at evey iteration.
- Code profiling: Surprisingly function calls weren't the problem, but there were a bunch of smaller improvements.
- These 50 iterations take about 10 minutes
- Sampling in random order and sampling u_md consecutively and s_mn for a fixed m, brings a big improvement!
